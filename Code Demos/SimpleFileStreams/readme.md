## SimpleFileStreams
This project demonstrates the use of file streams in C#. The code includes a `StreamReader` to read a file named 'HelloFundamentals.txt'. It reads the file line by line and prints each line to the console. The code also includes exception handling for `FileNotFoundException`, `OutOfMemoryException`, and general `Exception`.

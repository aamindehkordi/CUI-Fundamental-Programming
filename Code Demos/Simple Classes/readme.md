# Simple Classes

This subfolder contains two projects demonstrating different aspects of working with simple classes in C#. Here is a brief summary of each project:

1. BaseballStats: This project demonstrates the use of classes to model a baseball player and their game stats. It includes methods for adding game stats and calculating the player's batting average.

2. MathPoints: TODO

To run the projects, you will need a C# compiler such as the one provided by .NET. Clone the repository, navigate to the project you want to run, and compile the .cs file.

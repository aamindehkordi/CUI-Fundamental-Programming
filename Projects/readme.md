# Projects

This folder contains several projects completed as part of the 'CUI-Fundamental-Programming' course. Each project is contained in its own subfolder and includes a README with a brief description and summary of the project.

## - [Battleship Project](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Projects/BattleshipProject%20-%203)

This project is a simulation of the game Battleship. The task was to create an agent that can play Battleship against other agents. The agent uses a probabilistic approach to determine the most likely location of the opponent's ships based on the information it has. The agent's code is contained in the 'MyBattleshipAgent.cs' file.

## - [Stegosaurus Project](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Projects/Stegosaurus%20-%204)

This project is part of the 'CUI-Fundamental-Programming' course. The task was to create a program that can perform steganography on bitmap images. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. In this case, the program is designed to hide a secret message within a bitmap image.

## - [Fantasy Football Geeks](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Projects/Fantasy%20Football%20Geeks%20-%202)

This project is a simulation of a fantasy football game. The code is written in C# and consists of several classes that represent different aspects of the game, such as players and game statistics.

## - [Show me the money](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Projects/Show%20me%20the%20money%20-%200)

This project is a simple loan calculator. The user inputs the loan amount, interest rate, and term in years. The program then calculates the monthly payment amount and generates an amortization schedule.

# Methods & Recursion

This subfolder contains five projects demonstrating different aspects of methods and recursion in C#. Here is a brief summary of each project:

1. Bottlesofmilk: This project demonstrates the use of a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers. It prints out the lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Milk on the Wall".

2. Forloops: This project demonstrates the use of a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to a user-specified number.

3. Leapyear: This project demonstrates the use of a for loop and conditional statements to print out all the leap years in a millennium.

4. SwitchStatements: This project demonstrates the use of a switch statement to print out different messages based on the day of the week entered by the user.

## Running the Code Demos

To run the code demos, you will need a C# compiler such as the one provided by .NET. Clone the repository, navigate to the code demo you want to run, and compile the .cs file.

# String Processing
The 'String Processing' folder contains several projects that demonstrate different operations that can be performed on strings. Here are the projects contained in this folder:

1. **Concordance**: This project demonstrates how to create a concordance, which is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, with their immediate contexts. Every word is associated with its line number.

2. **DnaSearch**: This project demonstrates how to search for a DNA sequence within a larger sequence and count the number of occurrences.

3. **MadLibs**: This project demonstrates the creation of a simple 'Mad Libs' game. The program prompts the user to enter various types of words (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), and then generates a story by filling in the blanks with these words.

4. **MorseCodeTranslator**: This project demonstrates a simple Morse code translator. It translates Morse code to English and vice versa.

5. **PhoneNumbers**: This project demonstrates a simple phone number formatter. It takes an array of phone numbers in various formats and standardizes them to a consistent format.

6. **SortingStrings**: This project demonstrates different ways to check for string equality and how to sort strings lexicographically.

7. **SplittingUrls**: This project demonstrates how to split URLs into their constituent parts: protocol, server, and resource.

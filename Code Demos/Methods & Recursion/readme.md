# Methods & Recursion

This subfolder contains five projects demonstrating different aspects of methods and recursion in C#. Here is a brief summary of each project:

1. Fibonacci: This project demonstrates the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

2. MinMax: This project demonstrates the use of methods to find the minimum and maximum values in an array of integers.

3. OutputParams: This project demonstrates the use of output parameters in methods. Output parameters are a special kind of method parameter that can be used to return more than one value from a method.

4. SalesTax1-5: These projects demonstrate the calculation of sales tax using methods. Each project builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts such as struct, arrays, and default parameters.

To run the projects, you will need a C# compiler such as the one provided by .NET. Clone the repository, navigate to the project you want to run, and compile the .cs file.

## Running the Code Demos

To run the code demos, you will need a C# compiler such as the one provided by .NET. Clone the repository, navigate to the code demo you want to run, and compile the .cs file.

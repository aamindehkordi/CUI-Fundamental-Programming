# Simple Classes README
The 'Simple Classes' subfolder contains two projects demonstrating different aspects of working with simple classes in C#:

## BaseballStats
This project demonstrates the use of classes to model a baseball player and their game stats. It includes methods for adding game stats and calculating the player's batting average.

## MathPoints
The 'MathPoints' project demonstrates the use of classes to model a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The `CartesianPoint` class includes methods for calculating the distance between two points, the distance from the point to another point, and the magnitude of the point (distance from the origin).

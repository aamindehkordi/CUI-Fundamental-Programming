# Fundamentals of Programming

This repository is a collection of work completed as part of the 'CUI-Fundamental-Programming' course. It showcases a variety of programming concepts and techniques, with each project or code demo focusing on a specific topic. The repository is organized into three main subdirectories: 'Code Demos', 'Projects', and 'Scratch'.

## [Code Demos](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Code%20Demos)

The 'Code Demos' directory is a comprehensive collection of code samples that demonstrate different aspects of programming in C#. Each subfolder focuses on a specific topic, such as arrays, loops, or recursion, and contains several related code files. These demos serve as a valuable resource for understanding the fundamentals of C# programming.

## [Projects](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Projects)

The 'Projects' folder contains a series of complex projects that were completed as part of the course. These projects provide a deeper exploration of programming concepts and often involve the development of a complete program or game. Each project is contained in its own subfolder and includes a README with a detailed description and summary of the project.

## [Scratch](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Scratch)

The 'Scratch' directory is a space for experimental and exploratory projects. These projects often involve exploring a new concept or technique in a less structured context. Each project focuses on a specific topic and contains related code files. The 'Scratch' directory serves as a sandbox for creative and innovative programming.

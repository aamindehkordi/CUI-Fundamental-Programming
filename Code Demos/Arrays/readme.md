# Arrays

This folder contains various code demos related to arrays in C#. Each subfolder focuses on a specific aspect of arrays.

## Subfolders

1. BoundingErrors: This project demonstrates what happens when you try to access an array element that is out of bounds. It's a simple but important lesson in array indexing.

2. IteratingArrays: This project demonstrates how to iterate over an array using a foreach loop and a for loop. It also shows how to modify array elements during iteration.

3. ReverseArray: This project demonstrates how to reverse an array. It does this by swapping elements from the start and end of the array and moving towards the middle.

4. SimpleArrays: This project demonstrates how to declare and initialize arrays. It also shows how to access array elements.

5. StartOfBible: This project demonstrates how to create and work with a 3D array. It uses a 3D string array to represent the structure of the Bible.2. [IteratingArrays](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Fundamental-Programming/tree/main/Code%20Demos/Arrays/IteratingArrays): This subfolder contains a code demo demonstrating how to iterate over arrays.

## Running the Code Demos

To run the code demos, you will need a C# compiler such as the one provided by .NET. Clone the repository, navigate to the code demo you want to run, and compile the .cs file.
